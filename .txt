1. What is Emmet?
Ans:-   
Emmet, formerly known as Zen Coding, is a toolkit designed to improve the HTML and CSS workflow 
for web developers and designers. 
It's a set of tools and shortcuts that enable developers to write HTML and CSS code more efficiently and quickly. 
Emmet is especially popular among front-end developers who work on building and styling web pages.

Emmet provides a shorthand syntax for writing HTML and CSS code, 
allowing you to create complex structures with just a few keystrokes. 
It's often used in code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) that support the Emmet plugin.

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
Ans:-   
Library:
Think of a library like a toolbox. It has tools (functions) that you can use whenever you need them. 
You decide when and how to use each tool in your work.

Framework:
Imagine a framework as a recipe for making a specific dish. 
It not only gives you the ingredients (functions) but also tells you how to put them 
together step by step. You follow the recipe to create the final dish (your application).

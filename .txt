1. What is Emmet?
Ans:-   
Emmet, formerly known as Zen Coding, is a toolkit designed to improve the HTML and CSS workflow 
for web developers and designers. 
It's a set of tools and shortcuts that enable developers to write HTML and CSS code more efficiently and quickly. 
Emmet is especially popular among front-end developers who work on building and styling web pages.

Emmet provides a shorthand syntax for writing HTML and CSS code, 
allowing you to create complex structures with just a few keystrokes. 
It's often used in code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) that support the Emmet plugin.

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
Ans:-   
Library:
Think of a library like a toolbox. It has tools (functions) that you can use whenever you need them. 
You decide when and how to use each tool in your work.

Framework:
Imagine a framework as a recipe for making a specific dish. 
It not only gives you the ingredients (functions) but also tells you how to put them 
together step by step. You follow the recipe to create the final dish (your application).

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
Ans:-
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is like a network of super-fast storage for website stuff (like images and videos). 
We use it to make websites load faster and handle lots of visitors without crashing. 
It works by storing copies of the website's files in different places around the world, 
so when you visit a site, you get stuff from a nearby storage, making things quicker.

Example:-
Imagine you have a big box of toys at your home.
Your friends from different neighborhoods also want to play with your toys. 
Instead of making your friends travel all the way to your home, you decide to keep smaller boxes of toys in their 
neighborhoods too. This way, they can easily get toys to play with without traveling far.

Similarly, a CDN is like having these smaller boxes of toys in different neighborhoods around the world, 
but instead of toys, it's copies of website stuff like pictures and videos. When people want to see a website,
they get the stuff from the closest "box," which makes the website load faster for them. 
It's a way to share website stuff quickly and easily, no matter where you are.

4. Why is React known as React?
Ans:-
 React "reacts" to changes in data by efficiently updating the user interface without unnecessary reloading or rendering. 
 This approach to building interfaces makes it faster and more responsive, which is why the library is called React.

5. What is crossorigin in script tag?
Ans:-
The crossorigin attribute in a <script> tag is used to control how the browser should handle cross-origin requests 
when loading scripts from different domains. 
Cross-origin requests occur when a web page requests resources 
(like scripts, fonts, or images) from a domain different from the one the page itself is hosted on.

The crossorigin attribute has a few different values:

anonymous: This is the default value. 
It means that the browser will make the request for the script without including any credentials 
(like cookies or HTTP authentication) from the requesting page's origin. 
This is useful when you're fetching public resources that don't require specific user credentials.

use-credentials: This value indicates that the browser should include credentials when making the cross-origin request. 
It's used when the requesting page needs to send user-specific data (like cookies) along with the request. 
This requires the server to be configured to accept cross-origin requests with credentials.

6.What is diference between React and ReactDOM?
Ans:-
React is responsible for creating and managing the user interface components, their structure, and behavior, 
while ReactDOM is responsible for the actual rendering of those components into the browser's DOM. 
They work together to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Ans:-
react.development.js:
Purpose:-- Designed for development stages of a project.
Error Messages:-- Contains detailed error messages and warnings.
Debugging:-- Helps developers identify issues during development.
File Size:-- Larger file size due to additional error-checking code.
Advantage:-- Assists in catching and fixing bugs during development.

react.production.js:
Purpose:-- Optimized for production environments.
Error Messages:-- Excludes error messages and warnings to reduce file size.
Performance:-- Smaller file size results in faster downloads and better performance.
Debugging:-- Lacks detailed error messages, which makes it harder to debug in production.
Advantage:-- Enhances website or app performance for end-users in production.

8.What is async and defer?
Ans:-
Async:
Loading:-- Fetches and executes the script while the page continues loading.
Execution:-- Runs the script as soon as it's ready, possibly before the page finishes loading.
Order:-- No guarantee on the order scripts execute in if multiple are present.
Use Case:-- Good for independent scripts that don't depend on the page's content.

Defer:
Loading:-- Fetches the script while the page continues loading.
Execution:-- Runs the script after the HTML parsing is done, in the order they appear.
Order:-- Scripts execute in the sequence they're placed in the page.
Use Case:-- Ideal for scripts that require the DOM to be fully parsed before execution.

9. What is React Router Dom?
Ans:-
React Router Dom is used to build single-page applications i.e. applications that have many pages or components 
but the page is never refreshed instead the content is dynamically fetched based on the URL. 
This process is called Routing and it is made possible with the help of React Router Dom.

10. What is useEffect in React?
Ans:-
The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. 
Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers. 
useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

11. Can you explain the concept of event pooling in React synthetic events?

Ans:-
Event pooling in React means that when an event is fired,
React reuses the event object instead of creating a new event object for each event. 
It helps to reduce memory usage.

12. how does virtual DOM help in improving application performance?
Ans:-
the virtual DOM helps improve application performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations, 
and avoid unnecessary updates and re-render the web application user interface, 
hence the web application makes fast and more efficient.

13. what are the advantages of using flux architecture in react for state management?
Ans:-
The advantages of using flux architecture in react for state management are:-
1. It provides a structured and efficient approach to managing the state in React application.
2. flux has better code quality
3. It is very maintainable and scalable.
4. It is very easy to debug.

14. what is JWT and how it works?
Ans:-
The full form of JWT is JSON Web Token and It is an open industry to share information between client and server.
like if you send JWT (username, password) to the server, and when the server receives this information it will generate a 
signature from your given JWT and verifies it and If JWT is valid it sends back the response.

......................................................................................................................

15. What is CORS and how does it affect API requests?
Ans:-
The CORS mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers. 
Modern browsers use CORS in APIs such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch to decrease the risks of cross-origin HTTP requests.

16. What is CSS Combinator?
Ans:-
A Combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selector.
There Are four types of combinators:-
a. Adjacent Sibling selector
b. General Sibling Selector
c. Child Selector
d. Descendant Selector.

17. what is the differences between HTML and React event Handling?
Ans:-
React Event handling is similar to HTML only some changes in Syntax.
Such as:- React use CamelCase for event name while HTML use Lowercase.
instead of passing string as an event handler. we pass function in React.

18. What are some of Redux DevTool's most essential features?

Ans:- Redux DevTools is a browser extension and it is used in debugging in the Redux applications. 
the main purpose of the redux dev tool are:-
1. It lets you go back in time by “canceling” actions.
2. You can inspect the current state of your Redux store, including nested objects and arrays
3. If you change the reducer code, each “staged” action will be re-evaluated.
4. You can update the state from the DevTools interface.

19. Explain how data flows between the Model, View, and Controller components in a React application.
Ans:-
The data flow in a React application follows a unidirectional manner.

Model: It is responsible for maintaining the behavior and data of an application.
View: It is used to display the model in the user interface.
Controller: It acts as an interface between the Model and the View components.
